# Biological Computation - ex2
Generate, list, and identify isomorphic connected subgraphs from directed graphs.

# Motif Finder – Biological Computation Exercise 2

This repository contains a Python implementation of Exercise 2 from the *Biological Computation* course. The task involves generating all **weakly connected directed subgraphs (motifs)** of a given size `n`, and counting their occurrences in an input directed graph.
